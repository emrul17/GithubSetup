Git is a version control system. It is used to manage project in collaborative environment. Different developer can work on the same project and maintain workflow. 

Github is remote server to store project. Making the repository public, gives the opportunity to share projects with others. 

In this Repository, I talk about how to create and work with github. 
First of all, we need to install the git in our system for windows operating system from the website: https://git-scm.com/downloads. 
Mac comes with built in git. 
Next step is to create a github account to the link: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Once the settings are done. The following steps are performed to push the repository to github from local machine.

1. Create a folder in the local machine
2. Open the Visual Studio Code Editor and open the folder
3. Create files as needed
4. Open the git bash from the start menu and navigate the specified folder.
5. Use --git init-- to initiate the repository
6. Use --git add file_name-- to add the file
